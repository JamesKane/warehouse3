# YDNA-Warehouse v3

This project is the next generation of the [YDNA-Warehouse.org](https://ydna-warehouse.org), a platform for Citizen
Scientists and genealogists to collaborate human Y-DNA phylogeny.  The warehouse is designed as a replacement effort for the [ISOGG YSNP Tree](https://isogg.org/) as free and open resource, while addressing the original shortcoming of not retaining direct sources for branch
definitions.

The platform is built on AWS Serverless Architecture in the backend with a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) front-end
application.
